## 🧪 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genai-developer-study-guide.git
   cd genai-developer-study-guide
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run any of the projects from the `/projects/` directory.
